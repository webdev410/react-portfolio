				I am highly-motivated and love learning new things. I have
				taught myself a variety of different skills and always dive in
				passionately with both feet. Previous to completing this boot
				camp, I ran a successful band and was able to work as a
				self-employed musician for 5 years. I ran a successful business
				that grossed over $100,000 per year for 3 of those 5 years. I
				self-taught myself audio-engineering at a very high level and
				put together a live show that included complex musical
				technologies. We dominated our local market and had many once in
				a lifetime experiences.

				I also have a lot of experience working from home as I was an
				AppleCare At-Home Advisor in college and was allowed to work
				from home while working for Ticketmaster. As I previously said,
				I feel Iâ€™ve found my calling during this boot camp and I am
				eager to join the workforce.
